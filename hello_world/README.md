# Overview
# Hello World â€“ C# Fundamentals Exploration

## Description of the Software:
This is a basic console application developed in C# that outputs a simple "Hello, World!" message to the screen. While minimal in functionality, it serves as a foundational step in understanding how C# handles program structure, syntax, compilation, and runtime behavior.

## Purpose for Creating this Software:
As a software engineer continuously developing my programming skills, this project represents the beginning of my deeper engagement with the C# language and the .NET ecosystem. The goal of this exercise is to gain hands-on experience with Visual Studio, familiarize myself with the C# syntax, and understand how console applications are built and executed.

# Development Environment

# Tools Used to Develop the Software:
To develop this project, I used Visual Studio Community Edition, which provides a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for .NET development. I also utilized the built-in .NET SDK and C# compiler (csc) that comes with Visual Studio to write, build, and run the application. Version control was managed using Git for basic source tracking, even for small projects, to maintain good development practices.

## Programming Language Used:
The application was written in C#, a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. C# is known for its strong type safety, rich class libraries, and seamless integration with the .NET framework. It is widely used for building Windows applications, web services, and enterprise-grade software. In this project, I focused on the foundational syntax of C# and its execution flow in a console-based environment.
